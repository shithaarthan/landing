## Recommendation for Your App

Based on your current design and goals, I'd suggest:

**Option 5: Carousel Hero** - It keeps the before/after comparison you have but shows multiple examples, building more confidence. It's engaging without requiring user interaction.

**OR**

**Stick with current slider** but add these enhancements:
1. Add subtle parallax effect on scroll
2. Add a small "Swipe to see more examples" that cycles through 3 different transformations
3. Add animated particles/sparkles around the slider for premium feel
4. Add a video play button that opens a modal with demo video

Would you like me to implement any of these alternatives?
